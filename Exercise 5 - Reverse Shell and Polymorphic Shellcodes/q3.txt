Going by your recommendation, my decoder is xoring out bytes that deviates out of the ascii range.
The structure of the code is basicaly by your structure:
	1. encode original shell code.
	2. generate decoder part.
	3. join the ecoder to the decoded shell.
	4. add meta: length, slide, decoder, shell, target address, null terminator.
The only non trivial chooices:
	1. As my shell code is only 123 bytes, my original solution was not generic enough for the smoke test.
		this implementation doesn't assume anything on the shell code: the offsets in eax are negated 127 bytes at a time (as this is the maximum possible immidiate)
	2. The as in q2, the "planted" address is computed accourding to shell code length.
