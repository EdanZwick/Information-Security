From the source code I saw that the function handle_connection in the server side reads data from the destenation
file into a 1024 byte buffer without checking first for the data's length.

This buffer is kept on stack, and using ida and gdb I concluded that input of 1044 bytes will just write over the function's return address.
this Causes the server side to crash.
As per convention, another NULL terminator is added (even hackers need to keep their manners).

Inorder for the data to be recieved, the messege legnth is added before the messege.

The null terminator doesn't seem to cause problems now. If I see that it interferes with somthing it will be removed.
