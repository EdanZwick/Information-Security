The code searches for the first Byte (after the address stored in register ESI) holding 0.
Since ESI is commonly used as a pointer to a char in string, in that context this code looks for the null terminator in a string.
When the code finishes ECX register will hold the nuber of chars in the given String.

So, to conclude- the code counts the number of chars in the string stored at address ESI.
