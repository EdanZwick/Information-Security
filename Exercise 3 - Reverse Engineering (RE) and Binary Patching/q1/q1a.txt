To make our explenation clear we shall call the first byte of the file (byte 0): n, and the second byte (byte 1) x.

The function returns that a messege is valid if this condition is filled:
	the bitwise xor of the n bytes of the file between (2,n+2) with a key (47) is exactly x.
This is similar (yet not identical) to a chaining proccess of some encryption algorithms.

my function simply preformes the same check on a given file.
