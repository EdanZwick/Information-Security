The second way to fix a messege is to make it skip the whole validation proccess.
by choosing the first byte of the file to be 0, no xor operation will be made. the key will just be compaired to the second byte of the file.
if we change that second bytr to be the key itself, the msgcheck function compares the key to itself (which unseprisingly) turns out true.
