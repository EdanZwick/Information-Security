The work on this section was split into three parts:
	a. by looking at the dump recieved from q1a, I calculated that the wanted return address needs to be exactly in offset 70 of the input.
	b. implementing the assembly shell code: it consists of a nop slide (The jump address I used was to the middle of the slide), 
		preparing execev syscall (some work-around was needed to get rid of 0's), and adding the return address in the end so it will fit exacly on stack for the ret call in check password.
	c. python script to assemble my code and pass it as an argument to sudo
