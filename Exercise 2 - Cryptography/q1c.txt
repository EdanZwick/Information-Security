Documentation for  plaintext_score function:

I implemented a fairly straight forward function that seemed to serve me well in the next few problems:
	1. increment score slightly whenever latin characters appear.
	2. decrement score slightly whenever non alphabetical characters appear (even as these can appear, they are usually far less common).
	3. decrement score drasticly if very unccommon characters such as drawings appear as we do not expect to see them in normal english text.
