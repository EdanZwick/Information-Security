Documentation for brute force function:

While the implementation of the key in this assignment is an array of ints that are artificialy limited between 0 - 255, one can think of the key as a binary number that contains 8*key_length bits.
to go over all differnt key combinations, one can just repetedly increment the key by 1 checking the plain text this key will output.

This is exactly what my code is implementing. we start with an all 0's array. every iteration we examin what plaintext this key will produce and rank it.
then we increment the key by 1 by adding 1 to cell 0 of key array. the last while loop is used to handle overflows (if any of the array ints go over 255).

finaly the code prints the most likely string produced
