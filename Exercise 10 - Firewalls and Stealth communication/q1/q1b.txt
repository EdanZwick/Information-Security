The data structure I choose for my solution was a hash table, given by python dictionary. 
Keys in the dictionary are IP addresses, while the value is a list of times when this IP tried to syn.
On each syn attempt from an IP, all records from more than a minute ago are deleted and the new attempt is appended to the list for IP.
If the list contains more than 15 items, block function is called.
The block is done by creating a new IP tables rule, dropping all trafic from that IP.
To prevent us from keeping unused data, every 2 minutes we clean all IP's that didn't try to syn since the last cleaning (actualy happens when a packet is recieved and it has been more than 2 mins since last clean).
