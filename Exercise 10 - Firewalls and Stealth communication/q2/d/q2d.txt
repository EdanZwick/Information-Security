The algorithm Winston and Julia will use is:
	Winston translates the text to binary, padding with 0's to make length divisable by 3.
	Winston sends 3 bits, their sequance number and the total number of messages (in ack field) and waits for Julia to ack.
	Julia sniffs waiting for a message in the wanted parameters (packet type, ports, flags), adds the recieved message to buffer and acks.
	Appon ack from the previous message, Winston sends the next packet and so forth, untill all packets were sent.
	Julia removes the padding and translates the message back to text.

In each script I tried to create as many auxiliary functions as possible to improve readability.
