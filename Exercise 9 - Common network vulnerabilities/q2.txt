The main chalenge in this question was getting the TCP parameters correct, so our victim will accept our injected packet.
I got them right by using the parameters in the intercepted packet:
	1. Our packet's sequance number is 1 larger than the one the victim acknowledged.
	2. Our packet acked the whole message recieved (sequacnce number + length).

The whole logic:
	a. Check if packet is a request for the courses website (by looking for http get and host=website).
	b. Generate a response accourding to parameters in intercepted packet.
	c. Add the raw layer (the given http response).
