Examining the authentication function, I'ts clear there is no chance of executing code there,
What did seem obvious is a vulnerability in the authentication itself.
There is nothing preventing an empty string to be checked.
As the function tries to compare the input to the same amount of charachters in users entry, on empty input it compares empty strings.
Thus feeding the module with a string starting with two colons, will make the input authenticate and execute any following command.
