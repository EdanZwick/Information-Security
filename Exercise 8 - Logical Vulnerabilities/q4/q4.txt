Looking at bob's and alice's code, the first thing that I noticed (it was also heavily hinted in the assignment) is that bob doesn't use json to parse the data but a regular expression.
That made me look into the operation difference between of these two services.
I noticed that json allows sending several fields with the same name but writes just the last one to file.
That was a hint that the load function might behave in the same way.
I first created an innocent json dump with the command echo cool, and it's valid signature I got from the demo.
Manipulating the json dump as a string I added another command field, this time with my malicious code.
Alice's code ignores my field and varifies the json.
Bob's code looks for the first appearance of "command" and executes my code.
